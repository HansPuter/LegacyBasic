# LegacyBasic

Writing my own BASIC implementation to run the programs in book [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games). Implementation language will be "C" with the idea of converting it lateron to C++20 and [V Programming Language](https://vlang.io/) 
[[changed 20235008]] Will switch to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and forget V Programming Language for now
